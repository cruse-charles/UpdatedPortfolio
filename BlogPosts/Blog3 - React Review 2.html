				<h2>A Quick Intro to useEffect</h2>
				<p>By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after rendering. Some
					examples of what it can be used for: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
				</p>
				<h2>What goes into a useEffect function?</h2>
				<p>useEffect accepts two arguments, with the second argument being optional.
					useEffect(function, dependency)
					The function argument is a callback function and is what our code will be performing, and
					it'll run according to the second argument, the dependency.
					There are three inputs into the dependency argument:

				<ul>
					<li> Without an argument, the function will run on every render.</li>
					<li>With an empty array, the function runs only once, after mounting.</li>
					<li>With a variable in the array, the function runs only when that variable is changed. Multiple
						variables can be added to the array too.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<img src="../images/Blog3/Picture1.png" />
				<h2>Component LifeCycle</h2>
				<p>Each component has a life cycle that is monitored by React. This life cycle refers to when we see a
					component on a website to when we no longer see it. The lifecycle consists of three phases:</p>
				<p>Mounting: This is the point at which a component's life commences. By using useEffect and specifying
					an empty array [] as the dependency, the effect runs once after the initial render.</p>
				<p>Updating: Throughout a component's lifetime, it may update according to changes in state and props.
					All the data the effect needs to 'watch' should be specified in the dependency array.
				</p>
				<p>Unmounting: When a component is no longer needed, it's removed. A cleanup function returned from the
					effect
					helps prevent memory leaks during this phase (more on this in a moment).
				</p>
				<img src="../images/Blog3/Picture2.png" />
				<h2>What is a cleanup function?</h2>
				<p>Imagine your code sets up a subscription in a component. But aligning with the natural lifecycle, our
					component might be removed from the DOM at some point. If our component is gone but our subscription
					is still active, we have a problem -- this is a memory leak!</p>
				<p>Memory leaks subtly eat up your system resources and can cause your application to slow down or
					crash. Hence, it's important to clean up your task if the component unmounts during the effect's
					lifecycle.
				</p>
				<p>The cleanup part of useEffect comes into play here. Upon returning a function from a useEffect hook,
					React interprets this as a cleanup function and invokes it before the component is removed from the
					UI to prevent memory leaks.
				</p>
				<h2>Let's show an example of fetching data and having a cleanup function</h2>
				<p>Here, we are using our useEffect to fetch data for this component. Here we are fetching data based on
					the id of the item that the user is looking at, which could be a post or a comment or anything else.
					Here, we are getting a post that matches the id.
				</p>
				<img src="../images/Blog3/Picture3.png" />
				<p>But what if we have a button that is linked to using this fetching of data? And what if we click it
					really fast over and over? That's where a cleanup can come in. If a user clicks 5 times super fast,
					the component will re-render 5 times and it's not a great user experience because we are just going
					to see the post that returns either first or last if we are just getting a random post. So we want
					to control that better, by aborting fetch requests if they aren't finished if a user has clicked
					many times.
				</p>
				<img src="../images/Blog3/Picture4.png" />
				<p>This here will make sure that a fetch is aborted by running the clean-up feature of useEffect that
					will abort our fetch request. Now when we click 5 times super fast, we will just get one post
					rendered.</p>
				<h2>So when do we use this?</h2>
				<p>Well, it's not too common to use this outside of personal projects. There are libraries that do a lot
					of this work as well for us, from caching to loading states
					to fetching data to cleanups, such as SWR Vercel or React Query. We'll take a look at these later!
					But it's important that we know what this stuff is doing under the hood!
