				<h2>Creating Students and Connecting Them With a Consultant</h2>
				<p>
					I'm starting with the general dashboard, where consultants can quickly view and manage their students. 
					The first piece I'm working on is a high-level student card to display key information like personal details, 
					overall application progress, and the number of pending tasks. Each card will also link directly to a student's 
					detailed profile page.
				</p>
				<h2>The Student Creation Form</h2>
				<p>
					I started by building a form inside a modal that allows a consultant to add a new student. The student data is 
					structured like this: personal information, academic stats, and broader progress tracking. Progress tracking hasn't 
					been put into its own object yet because there are some other points about how I will try to handle that later.

					Here's how I structured the formData state:

				<pre><code class="language-tsx">
					const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
						personalInformation: { ... },
						academicInformation: { ... },
						pendingTasks: '',
						progress: '',
						...
					});
				</code></pre>
				<p>This was my first time working with nested state in React. I quickly learned it wasn't as straightforward as using 
					flat fields, especially with the handleInputChange function. I had to specifically target the personalInformation 
					sub-object when updating state. This had to be done for the academicInformation and top-level fields as well.</p>
				<pre><code class="language-tsx">
					const handlePersonalInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
						const { name, value } = e.target;
						setFormData((prevData) => ({
							...prevData,
							personalInformation: {
								...prevData.personalInformation,
								[name]: value,
							}
						}))
					}
				</code></pre>
				<h2>Learning Firebase on the Fly</h2>
				<p>
					Next up is creating the users. Firebase has been surprisingly fast, especially with it being my first time using it. 
					I'm using Firestore to store student records, and I'll later be using Firebase Auth for role-based access 
					(consultant vs. student). I'm happy to see how much boilerplate I can skip and just focus on building what I need.
				</p>
				<p>
					Creating a student and connecting it to a consultant, then fetch all the correct students was a bit challenging 
					but here is how I handled it:
					<ul>
						<li>When adding a student, I find a reference to the document and pass an object of values that I want to add in, 
							passing in the consultantDocRef from the currentUser info.</li>
						<li>After creating this doc, I also need to make sure the consultant has the user in their own array of students. 
							Firebase documentation suggested arrayUnion, which was quick and easy to do.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
                <pre><code class="language-tsx">
					const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
						e.preventDefault();

						// Check if consultantDocRef is provided
						if (!consultantDocRef) {
							console.error("Consultant is not provided.");
							return;
						}

						// Create a new student document in the "studentUsers" collection
						try {
							const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "studentUsers"), {
								personalInformation: formData.personalInformation,
								academicInformation: formData.academicInformation,
								pendingTasks: formData.pendingTasks,
								progress: formData.progress,
								nextDeadline: formData.nextDeadline,
								consultant: consultantDocRef,
							})

							// Update the consultant's document to include the new student
							await updateDoc(consultantDocRef, {
								students: arrayUnion(docRef)
							})

							// Callback to refresh student list or perform any other action after adding a student
							onStudentAdded();
							
							// Close the dialog after submission
							setOpen(false);

							console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id);
						} catch (error) {
							console.error("Error adding document: ", error);
						}
					}
				</code></pre>
				<p>In fetching students, I create a ref to the consultant document, which I pass down to adding students from above. 
					Then I need to extract the data from this ref using the .data() function. Retrieving the students was a bit difficult 
					since I had to build out the core section first then wrap it in a Promise.all to make sure I properly got the students 
					and not just promises. Then I set it to my students state and can iterate over that for rendering.</p>
				<pre><code class="language-tsx">
					const fetchStudents = async (user: FirebaseUser) => {
							try {
								// Get the consultant's document reference and snapshot
								const ref = doc(db, "consultantUsers", user.uid);
								setConsultantDocRef(ref);
								const consultantDocSnap = await getDoc(ref);

								// If the consultant document does not exist, set students to an empty array
								if (!consultantDocSnap.exists()) {
									setStudents([]);
									return;
								}

								// Extract student references from the consultant document
								const consultantData = consultantDocSnap.data();
								const studentRefs = consultantData.students || [];

								// Fetch each student's document data
								const studentDocs = await Promise.all(
									studentRefs.map(async (studentRef: DocumentReference<DocumentData>) => {
										const studentDocSnap = await getDoc(studentRef);
										return studentDocSnap.exists()
											? { id: studentDocSnap.id, ...studentDocSnap.data() }
											: null;
									})
								);

								// Filter out any null values due to possible deleted students or missing data
								setStudents(studentDocs.filter(Boolean));
							} catch (error) {
								console.log("Error fetching students:", error);
								setStudents([]);
							}
						};
				</code></pre>
				<h2>Future Problems With Data Fetching</h2>
				<p>
					One thing I'm expecting to have an issue with is that I don't want to fetch everything on the dashboard. If a 
					consultant has 10+ students, and each student has 50+ uploaded documents, that's a huge amount of data being 
					sent unnecessarily.
					From my research so far, the answer seems to be using subcollections. This way, the main student data is 
					lightweight and quick to fetch. Then, only when someone views a student's profile will I load the full document list.
					<br><br>
					So, what is a subcollection, exactly? In Firestore, every document can contain collections of its own, these are 
					subcollections. Fetching a student won't fetch its subcollections, unless specified.
					However, from what I've seen online, deleting subcollections isn't as simple as removing a top-level field. It'll 
					involve some sort of cloud function, which I've never used before, but I'll tackle that later. For now, I know I'm 
					designing the data structure with scalability and performance in mind.
				</p>
				<h2>What I Learned</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Nested state in React can be a bit tricky: updating sub-objects like had to be done carefully with proper placement
							 of spread syntax to avoid overwriting unrelated fields.</li>
						<li>Creating documents with meaningful IDs in Firestore requires using setDoc instead of addDoc.</li>
						<li>Storing references between documents is easy with Firestore. I store a DocumentReference to the consultant inside 
							the student doc, and update the consultant's doc with an arrayUnion.</li>
						<li>Subcollections help with performance by keeping student docs lightweight. Full document lists can be stored in a 
							student's subcollection and fetched only when needed, but Deleting subcollections isn't built-in, so I'll eventually 
							need a Firebase Cloud Function to fully clean up nested data when a student is deleted.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>What's Next</h2>
				<p>
					Right now, the priority is getting the student creation flow working smoothly, and then rendering student cards 
					on the dashboard. After that, I'll be building out a student's profile where users can start uploading tasks and 
					documents per student with everything being automatically tracked for submission and status.
